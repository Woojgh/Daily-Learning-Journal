<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 6 </h1>

Another great day on javascript dealing with creating objects.  We learned how to write functiones inside of our objects and how to use our methods that we created. We also learned about the DOM and what we can do with it.  We learned how to manipulate and access elemnts inside the DOm and how to get/update the DOM.
