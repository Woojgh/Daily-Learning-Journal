<h1> LJ Code 201 Day 1 </h1>

Today was a great refresher on some of the basics of html and javascript.  I did learn that when oushing something into an array,
you can add as many new components as youd like you just have to seperate each property with commas.
I did have a little trouble with using Gitbash on windows but i think just by using it in class I will be able to get a hang of it pretty 
eaisly.
Overall today was good anf I cannot wait for tomorrow!
