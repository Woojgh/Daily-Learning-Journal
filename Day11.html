<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 11</h1>
Today was GREAT! I got to brain storm a bunch of code with people so can't go wrong with that.  But beyond that again learned how to think in a different way.  While writing the user stories, I can see by asking those types of questions how I start to look at my code differently.  I looked back at my older codes and I am begininng to see a change.
