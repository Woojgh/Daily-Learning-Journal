Learning about ajax and HTTP seemed basic to me being that I have worked with them before, we will see during lab time.  However I did learn on how to correctly label and call things.  Now during an interview I won't be like use the thing that does this thing with that. I can say, "Use AJAX to retrieve from the server with only the necessary JSON data." Prety sweet!
