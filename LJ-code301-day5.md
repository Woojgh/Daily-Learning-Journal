<h1>LJ Code301 Day5</h1>

Now that I am starting to get the hang of handlebars and using jquery to implement my information, I am starting understand the bigger picture and when things are applicable for my application.  I am also loving data structures, that is my ish. I don't know why but even eric thought it was weird that I can get data structures much more easily then I can using jquery :P I cannot wait for more complex whiteboarding!!! Group stuff is the best btw, I am alwasys finding myself realizing the asnwer as Im asking the question to my peer. The teaching speed and information load is just right for me truthfully.  I feel like my brain is about to melt but I don't really find myself in a nuclear meltdown. Overall, I am tired but what an awesome week! I am going to have so much fun with this new information and already have.  I am turning my nav bar on my webpage to be a fight scene from mortal kombat depending on what interaction you choose.!!!!! THE POWER!!!!!!
